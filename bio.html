    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I am a recent graduate from Texas A&M University. Coding has always been my interest, and after coming out of college,
      I have immersed myself in the world of computers. I love coding and love practical application of code to make life easier and more efficient.
      Java is my favorite coding language, a language that introduced me into developing mobile applications.
      
    <br> <br>
      When not coding, I can be found testing apps in real life, gaming or even doing some commission painting work.
